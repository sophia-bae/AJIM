        <h2>Application Snapshots</h2>
        <p>
            A snapshot is a complete collection of all job application materials for all applicants on your main application list on a given date. A good time to take a snapshot is when the current search has just finished reviewing applications but before new search begins. It's the group manager's responsibility to take snapshots at appropriate times.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Click on the link below to create a new snapshot (you can exclude documents excluded or positions excluded from the new snapshots first if needed).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once you have created a snapshot, you could go back to this page and click on it below to download it to your own system for safekeeping. For a quicker download please click on  below (which appears 1 day after the snapshot was made) to download it directly from our long-term snapshot archive.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After you have verified the downloaded copy on your local system is good, you could delete the snapshot from here if needed. All snapshots can be kept here in the database for up to 3 years, but please help us reduce the operation cost by deleting unneeded snapshots whenever possible.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Instead of making snapshots, you can also get the latest application data quickly for any recent job posting from the 'EEO/EOE' link under the 'Admin' menu. Click on the 'appl list' link there, enter the job# into the 'job#s' box and press 'Get'. Click on 'zip' to download the same data.
                </li>
