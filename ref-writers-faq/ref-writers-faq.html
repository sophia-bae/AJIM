                            When an applicant at AcademicJobsOnline enters any Reference Writers onto their cover sheet, he or she also needs to check the "email notify on submit?" checkbox so that an email will automatically be sent to the Reference Writer. This email will contain both your password and instructions on how to proceed.

                            You will need to receive an email initiated by the Applicant which will contain a password and instructions on how to proceed. The applicant should go into their cover sheet and check the "email notify on submit?" checkbox. This will generate the email for you, with instructions and a password.

                            Reference letters may be addressed to a non-specific reader. This is usually the easiest format for a Reference Writer to use. In that case, the Writer should make the letter viewable to AcademicJobsOnline employers to whom the applicant makes an application.
                            <br><br>However, if a tailored letter to a specific employer is needed, it can be addressed to the specific employer and made available only to that employer. Additional letters should be submitted in the same manner if needed.

                            <br><br>If you wish to restrict the letter to all applications of a given type (e.g., postdocs), click on the blue arrow  and check the checkbox(es) for the type(s).

                            In this case, the applicant must have asked AcademicJobsOnline to resend the email. Perhaps, the applicant does not understand how to check for a letter submission or want you to submit a tailored letter for some employer.

                            Log in as usual to AcademicJobsOnline. Click on the name of the applicant for whom you have submitted a reference letter for and would like to make changes to. This will bring up the reference letter form, where you will make the change. Scroll down to the bottom to the "Expiration" section. Change the date in the format: YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY/MM/DD, YY-MM-DD, or YY/MM/DD.
