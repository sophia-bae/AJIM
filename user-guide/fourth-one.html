                Your department's AcademicJobsOnline administrator is able to register faculty for access to AcademicJobsOnline.org. Check with your AcademicJobsOnline administrator if you have not been registered yet.

            <h3>Login to <i>AcademicJobsOnline.org</i></h3>
            <p>
                To log in, go to the link on the main AcademicJobsOnline.org page under the Login subheader, ...as Faculty or staff at employer institutions. Enter your Email Address and the password your AcademicJobsOnline administrator has provided to you in email or in person.
                <br><br>You will also have two additional options: turn off caching and save my login. The default is neither.

                        You can turn off caching if you need extra security. This will prevent any of your AcademicJobsOnline pages from being stored on your computer. This would also mean that you could not utilize the Back button on your browser, since your previous pages would have not been stored for you.

                        "Save my login" will save your login information for future sessions, so that you will not need to enter your login information again.

                You will be on the List page once you have logged into AcademicJobsOnline.Org. The actions available to you are presented as *links* across the top of the page.

                <br><br>Following are steps that most departments will want to take as they get started:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <div class="first-bold">
                            &nbsp&nbsp<b>Review and rate your applications.</b>

                        </div>
                        <br>The List link is where you review and rate the applications for your positions. For more details, see List on the User Guide page.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div class="first-bold">
                            &nbsp&nbspPrint materials.

                        </div>
                        <br>Print an application by clicking on the applicant name in the List link or after utilizing the Search link. For more details, see List, Search on the User Guide page.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div class="first-bold">
                            &nbsp&nbspExperiment to learn more.

                        </div>
                        <br> Never enter TEST data into the "real" AcademicJobsOnline. It is often impossible to delete such data. You will want to use the DEMO VERSION of AcademicJobsOnline for this.

                        <br><br>To try out all the features of the AcademicJobsOnline.Org system without worry of having to later undo your experiments, utilize the AcademicJobsOnline DEMO Server, which is accessible from the AcademicJobsOnline.Org homepage. You can login in as different users (see the main page there for login info), but please do not enter any real data there.
