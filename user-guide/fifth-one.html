            <p>
                You can register for a AcademicJobsOnline account for your group by choosing the *New Employer* link on the main AcademicJobsOnline.Org header. This option is also available as the first bulleted item on the login screen for Faculty or staff at employer institutions.
                <br><br>Only one registration per department/group is needed; other staff and faculty in the group can be given access to the system by the original registrant at no additional cost. Accounts should be renewed annually.
                
                <br><br>If you select this item, you will get the Employer Request Form that is shown below. As a department/group, at the first item, you will select Department Level Membership in the "Membership Type" dropdown. This is the proper membership type to select even when your university/college has a school-wide institutional membership.
                <br><br>Here you need to provide basic identifying and contact information.
