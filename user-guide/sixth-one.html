            <h3>Registering for an Account</i></h3>
            <p>
                You can register for a AcademicJobsOnline account for your institution by choosing the *New Employer* link on the main AcademicJobsOnline.Org header. This option is also available as the first bulleted item on the login screen for Faculty or staff at employer institutions.
                <br><br>Only one registration per institution is needed; other staff at the institution can be given access to the system by the original registrant at no additional cost. Accounts should be renewed annually.

                <br><br>If you select this item, you will get the Employer Request Form that is shown below. As an institution, at the first item, you will select Institutional Level Membership in the "Membership Type" dropdown.
                <br><br>Here you need to provide basic identifying and contact information.
                <ul>
                    <li class="list-item">
                        Membership Type: If you want an Institution Membership, make sure that you select Institutional Level Membership in the "Membership Type" dropdown.
                    </li>
                    <li class="list-item">
                        The Job Contact Email address is public and is the email address that applicants will use, and Job Contact Name is the contact name for applicants to use.                    </li>
                    <li class="list-item">
                        Make sure that you have a valid email address in the Admin Email text box. This is the email address that the managers of the AcademicJobsOnline system will use to communicate with the institutions that have accounts on the system.

                    <li class="list-item">
                        Password: You can only use a password which contains at least 6 characters from at least two of these groups:lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, special characters. Please remember it!

                    <li class="list-item">
                        Account Verification and Payment: We will verify your information before we can open an account; this may take some time. - After verification, we will notify you by email using the admin email address you provided below. The email message will contain the payment and access instructions. Your account is ready once the payment has been accepted.

                    <li class="list-item">
                        Using AcademicJobsOnline for Advertising only: When registering, you may choose Ads only if you do NOT wish to receive applications electronically on the AcademicJobsOnline system. This shortens the forms necessary for job posting. The annual price is the same as for full use.

            <h3>Login to <i>AcademicJobsOnline.org</i></h3>
            <p>
                To log in, go to the link on the main AcademicJobsOnline.Org page under the Login subheader, ...as Faculty or staff at employer departments. Enter the Admin Email Address and password that your department submitted at registration time.
                <br><br>You will also have two additional options: turn off caching and save my login. The default is neither.
                <ul>
                    <li class="list-item">
                        You can turn off caching if you need extra security. This will prevent any of your AcademicJobsOnline pages from being stored on your computer. This would also mean that you could not utilize the Back button on your browser, since your previous pages would have not been stored for you.

                    <li class="list-item">
                        "Save my login" will save your login information for future sessions, so that you will not need to enter your login information again.

You can login in as different users (see the main page there for login info), but please do not enter any real data there.
