                The AcademicJobsOnline.org system recognizes several different classes or "roles" for users. A user is assigned different permissions when their account is created based on the type of account they have. This determines what information they have access to and the information they can add or modify. In other words, what a user can do and which pages or links they see (i.e., what permissions they have) depends on the type of account they have.
                <br><br>Listed below are the different types of accounts.
