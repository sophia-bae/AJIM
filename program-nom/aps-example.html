                Dear Colleagues:
                <br><br>The Division of Particles and Fields of the American Physical Society has established an award to honor exceptional contributions to instrumentation. The period of nominations for the 2023 award is now open.
                <br><br>The DPF Instrumentation Award and DPF Instrumentation Early Career Award are bestowed annually to honor exceptional contributions to instrumentation advancing the field of particle physics through the invention, refinement, or application of instrumentation and detectors. The awards recognize accomplishments in one or more of the following areas:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Conceptualization and development of unique instrumentation that has made a significant impact on the field.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Demonstration of the innovative use of instrumentation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stimulation of other researchers to use new techniques and methods.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Authorship of research papers or books that have had an influential role in the use of instrumentation.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <br>The DPF Instrumentation Award recognizes outstanding achievements in particle physics instrumentation that have had a major impact on the field through the awardee’s dedication over a substantial portion of an entire career, while the DPF Instrumentation Early Career Award recognizes achievements having a significant impact at an early career stage. For the purpose of this award, the early career stage is taken to be approximately 15 years from a Ph.D. or other terminal degree, with due account for interruptions and other factors in nominees’ careers. Award recipients will be invited to present a lecture at the 2023 CPAD meeting.

                <br><br>Complete nominations have:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A nominating letter of not more than 5,000 characters, about two pages</li>
                <li>A biographical sketch or CV</li>
                <li>
                    At least two, but not more than three, seconding letters.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <br>Nominations for the 2023 award will be accepted through Academic Jobs Online (AJO) from now through August 15th, 2023. Nominations will remain active for three years. The nominating letter and the CV should be uploaded to:

                <br><br>
                <span>
                    <a href="aps-example.html">This Current Page</a>
                </span>

                <br><br>and click the "Nominate" button in the above description titles. The names and email addresses of the supporting letter-writers should also be included in the nomination packet.

                <br><br>The membership of APS is diverse, so the nominees should reflect that diversity. The nomination of women or members of under-represented minority groups is therefore strongly encouraged. The membership is also global, so nominations of scientists from outside of the United States are welcome.

                <br><br>If you have any questions about the award, please contact the award committee chair, Kimberly Palladino. For technical questions about AJO, contact Robert Bernstein at rhbob@fnal.gov.
