                            The goal of the system is to facilitate the online application and hiring process; only people involved in the process can have access to your data and you can control how much they can access.
                            Your reference writers only have access to your general coversheet info and the list of jobs you have applied to.
                            The employers have access to all the data/files listed on your Application Status page. Other employers where you haven't applied for any jobs don't have access to any of your info, unless you are on the public "Job Wanted" list.

                            The phrase, "in use", means that the file was submitted to a job application. You will not be able to delete it, but you can always update it.
                            The "in use" status is cleared once the employer finishes with the job.

                            It is most likely that the PDF file for your official transcript is encrypted or signed, and we are not allowed to use it to generate your application package. One workaround is to scan and upload an unofficial version of the file.

                            If the video file is smaller than 10MB in size and it is in the standard HTML5 
                            supported media formats or other commonly used formats, you can upload it directly 
                            just like any other files.
                            The best way is to upload larger video files to some other video hosting sites such
                             as YouTube. Next, you can go to 
                             your Portfolio to add a new entry, where you can click on the "type in text/url/html 
                             directly here" link in the web form to enter the URL of your uploaded video in 
                             the text box provided. Please make sure the video is available 
                             while your job applications are being reviewed.

                            You can upload as many files as needed to your Portfolio, but each file has to be less than 10MB in size, and they can be audio/video files in the standard HTML5 supported media formats or other commonly used formats.
                            To upload a file larger than 10MB, you can either split it into smaller parts and upload each part (if the application form allows multiple files), or upload the file to some other website and provide an URL to it in the file upload form. For scanned documents, you can also try to scan it in a lower resolution or use a small file size format. You can also try to select "PDF Reduce" from the "Help" menu to help you reduce the file size first.

                            1. PDF files can be viewed easily on the most systems, and they can be easily rearranged. 
                            <br>2. We need to make sure any uploaded PDF files are free of errors so they can be correctly viewed everywhere; some PDF files do contain serious errors even though they may be perfectly viewable on some systems. 
                            <br>3. For identification, we need to embed a simple watermark in the PDF files.

                            For each uploaded file, we list 2 links for you to access the same file (maybe in different formats). The main reason is that we convert every file in the system to a PDF format in order to make sure they are readable by most readers and fix some common problems in the original files. The 1st link is always the original file, and the 2nd link the converted PDF file. You can access the file using either one.

                            The system uses an automated process to convert your file to a PDF format and the process sometimes may not output acceptable result due to fonts or other issues. If this happens, you can try to save your file in PDF format on your own system and then upload the PDF file directly, or follow the on-screen instructions (the last sentence of the red text block after submitting the form) to minimize the conversion and see if it works. To try the latter on a file you have already uploaded, go to your Portfolio page to click on the entry name for that file to bring up the uploading form, simply press 'Upload' button, and then click on the link inside the red text block.

                            This happens sometimes. You need to clear your web browser's cache to force it to 'forget' the old file.
                            If you see the message "POST Form ID is not valid for this submission, please reload....", clearing the cache should also fix it.

                            Once you have submitted your application (once) with all required material attached/selected and referees identified, there is no need to submit it again to make it 'final'. Any newly uploaded reference letters by those identified referees will be automatically added to the application; so are any updates in your Portfolio to the attached/selected material. You can always verify your applications by going to the 'Status' page and clicking on the employers' names to see (mostly) what the employers see.
                            You need to submit the application again only if you have updates to the questions in the application, new files to add or change the list of referees.

                            No, do not delete the files for the existing applications. To apply for new positions, you need to upload new files or reuse the existing files. You can choose different references on the application form too. But please remember that the search committees access your application material directly from your Portfolio for those files you have submitted in the job applications, hence you can't delete them.

                            The most likely cause might be either the files you have selected to be uploaded on the application form are too large or some of the files are not acceptable to the system. Another cause might be that your web browser (such as some old versions of IE and Safari) doesn't upload files properly.
                            <br>
                            <br>The workaround is to upload the files you need one by one before submitting the application itself: after login click on the 'Portfolio' menu at the top to go to your Portfolio page (that's where you keep all your files). Click on category name links such as 'Cover Letter' there or 'add your own...' link to upload your files. If any of your PDF files are larger than 10MB, you can try to select "PDF Reduce" from the "Help" menu to see if you can reduce the file sizes.
                            <br>
                            <br>Once you have all your files uploaded into your Portfolio, please don't forget to actually complete the application form for the job you want to apply in the first place, by finding the job on the Jobs list and clicking on the 'Apply' or 'Applied' link there to go back to the application form. On the application form you can just select those already uploaded files directly from your Portfolio using the dropdown menus there, and submit the application form by pressing the "Apply" or "Update" button.

                            The employer will always see the latest version of the files you submitted in the job application. No need to reapply. You can alway verify this by clicking on an employer's name on your 'Status' page, which shows you what each employer actually see (with the only differences that they can view the contents of your reference letters, and they can't see the file names of your letters and your portfolio items submitted.)

                            You are updating the existing information. The original application date stays the same.
                            Since the employers access the files submitted in a job application *directly* from your 'Portfolio', they are always acccessing the latest you have. There is no need to re-submit if you have only updated some files used in your applications. You need to re-submit if the answers to any questions in the application form need to be changed; for example, you want to select a different set of reference writers, choose different research interests or select a different file from your Portfolio for your CV.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Same thing is true for reference letters: no need to re-submit just because the selected reference writers have just uploaded more letters. The reference writers have control of which employers can access the letters, and the right employers automatically get the new letters.

                            You should have different names for different items. Suppose you submited "Cover_Letter_Duke" to Duke, and later one you click on the same entry "Cover_Letter_Duke" to uploaded a revised version to replace it, the one Duke sees will be the revised one since they are the same entry and the old one has been replaced and it's gone. But if you keep the old entry alone, and upload a new one with different name, the old one you have submited to schools will remain to be the one seen by schools.

                            Unfortunately there is no way to submit more items then those asked in the job ads. One way to get around this is to put the reprints etc on the web somewhere and put a link in your cover letter to that page. If you want to submit multiple PDF files for one required item, you can try to select "PDF Reduce" from the "Help" menu to concatenate the files into one PDF file first and submit the combined file.
                            <br> <br>Reference letters are different, as there is no limit on the number of letters you can submit to a job application.

                            The "interview signaling" is an additional way for applicants to signal their unusual interest in a particular position they are applying in order to improve their chances to get an interview. Currently not all employers use this feature, and you won't find it on all the application forms. 
                            <br> <br> Sending an interview signal is a way for you to let the group know that you are particularly interested in this position. Signal could be used for a position you are interested in but which would likely not interview you without it, since they might otherwise doubt whether you are likely to take their offer if one is made after interview. The search committee can also use the signals to break ties among similar applicants. You could use a signal to communicate your interest if you don't have any other better ways to do it for this position. You can only send 2 signals among all the applications you make on this system; you can't unselect the signal after 2 days once this has been submitted, unless you withdraw your application or until 6 months later or after the position has been finished.
                            <br> <br> This mechanism allows applicants to designate up to 2 of their applications in the system as 'particularly interested in' ('send 2 signals'). Applicants can only have 2 signals at any time and they can't be changed within 6 months after being set. Some applicants may choose not to send any. Signaling is only useful if this position usually receives many applications and applicants in your disciplines tend to apply for many other positions, and your search committee wants 'one more hint' beyond the usual application materials to see if the applicant is more than likely to accept the offer if one is made after interview. This is one more way for the applicant to 'grab your attention' among similarly qualified applicants, and it could lead your search committee to consider those applicants who appear to be over-qualified (who traditionally won't accept your offer) or slightly less ideal. Please keep in mind that not sending a signal conveys almost no information and it shouldn't be used by your search committee in their decision against an applicant.

                            First you enter all the references you need for all your applications on your standard coversheet form, and the system will create reference writer accounts for them if they are new. You can check the box "email notify on submit" or "email again" next to a reference writer and submit the form, or click on the green arrow (if there), if you want the system send a letter request email to the writer. Once the writers have received the email requests, they can use the quick upload link or the password in the email to login and upload their letters easily. Please note the system doesn't send any letter request email until you request it.
                            <br><br>Please note that each reference writer you entered in your coversheet must have a unique (i.e. different) and valid email address. They can't share the same email address. Writers are identified by their email addresses only in the system; please don't change their email addresses by yourself if they have already uploaded any letters. You can remove a writer from your reference list just by simply clearing the entry from your coversheet if you don't have any active applications where the writer is used and which don't allow any updates after deadlines. A staff person (or a school dossier service) can upload letters for multiple faculty members if you select the proper checkbox in the coversheet; please see the FAQ https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/faqs/0/21.

                            <br><br>Reference writers normally only need to submit the letters once. The best time to let the database email your referees is after you have applied a few jobs. Please allow the writers enough time to write the letter before the application deadlines.

                            <br><br>To check if a referee has uploaded any letters for you, go to your coversheet page. All uploaded letters will be listed there in red text. Or you can go to your Status page to see which letters each employer can access.

Your reference will then receive an email with login instructions. They can't login until you send them the email. Please note the system won't send any reference letter requests until requested.

                        <p>
                            There are 2 ways to do this:
                            <br><br>#1. You enter all your faculty letter writers, each with a different and unique email address, in your standard coversheet page. [If a staff is only responsible for uploading one reference writer's letters, you can just use that staff's email address, instead of the writer's actual email, and the writer's name in the reference entry, and skip this FAQ.] The letter writers can designate the same office staff to be their proxy and then the office staff will receive all letter requests and can upload letters on their behalf.

                            <br><br>To do that, the writers have to login to enter the office staff's email as their proxy. It's really easy for them to do; just login and click on the 'proxy' link near the bottom. They only need to do this once and the proxy works for all applicants they may have. Or the staff person can request to be added as a proxy for a faculty member by clicking on the 'Add as a proxy?' link on the reference login page.

                            <br><br>If the faculty member doesn't want to add the staff person as his/her proxy, he can simply forward the reference request emails to the staff person, and the staff person can click on the links in the emails to upload the requested letters.

                            <br><br>#2. If you really don't want to bother your writers directly (or you are dealing with a letter service), you need to enter the office staff's name and email, as a new reference entry, in your standard coversheet page only once, AND check the "must check here if the person above will upload letters on behalf of multiple writers:" checkbox. To email the login info to the staff person, check the "email notify writer on submit?" checkbox and submit. Using this option, there is no need to enter each actual faculty reference writers on your coversheet at all; only one entry for the staff person is sufficient. It's really important that you check the checkbox.

                            <br><br>Then this staff person can login and post all your letters (by clicking on your name on the Refs or Proxies list). It's good idea to tell the person to enter the writer's full name in the upload form. If multiple letters have been scanned into a single file, the staff person MUST enter all the writers' names and separate them by semicolons(;). The last point is important so your letters will be counted properly. Please note the staff person's name and email will be listed on your job applications, but the real writer's name will be displayed after each letter uploaded. *** Note to the staff person: if the letters you are asked to upload are generic in their contents, please upload them as generic letters (i.e., not select any employers on the uploading form). That way you only need to upload the same letters once. It's also a good idea to enter an appropriate 'Entry Name' for the letter and have the "allow applicant to see the Entry Name" box checked, to make it easy for the applicants to select the right letters on their application forms. ***

                            <br><br>Note to method #2: if you (the applicant) forgot to check the "must check here if the person above will upload letters on behalf of multiple writers" box on your coversheet form and the staff has already uploaded the letters, you'll find that system doesn't count your letters correctly on your Status page, since there is no way for the system to tell whom the actual writer is for each of the letters. To fix it, please check that box on your coversheet form for that staff and submit, *then* ask the staff person to login and click on the 1st link for each of the letters to enter the actual writer's name, check the box "keep the original uploading date unchanged", and submit.

                            First of all, create your accounts at MathJobs.Org and academicjobsonline.org using exactly the same email address, and enter the reference writers on your coversheets at the both places using exactly the same email addresses too. Once that's done, go back to your coversheet form, then you can click on the "import generic letters from MathJobs.Org" link for each reference writer to import the letters.
                            This also works the other way around to get generic letters from academicjobsonline.org to MathJobs.Org.

                            Yes, the most important aspect is to make sure the reference writers have uploaded different letters for the different positions. On the application form to each of the positions click on the green arrows for those reference writers you want to request letters for this position and send them a tailored request. Please note the application form won't have any green arrows if the position doesn't require any actual reference letters. Once the writers have received the request, they can click on a link in the email to upload their tailored letter for this position. The writers have to make sure the right employer and position are selected on the letter uploading form in order for the system to use the letter properly. You can verify the letters have been uploaded for a given position only by going to your coversheet form or the Status page.
                            <br><br>Above all, you can also use different sets of reference writers for different positions in the same department.

You can arrange it by going to the position ad page (for example <a href="https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/jobs/4870">this link</a>) and set the position's type to postdoctoral.

                            During the active application period, go to your "Status" screen and select the job title of the school for which you have applied. At the bottom of that screen, use the withdraw button.
                            <br><br>Once a job is marked as finished by the employer, you are not able to withdraw your application. AcademicJobsOnline give employers the right to access records of completed job searches.                               </p>

                            You cannot delete the list. However, the old job applications will disappear after the employer marks the jobs as finished or deleted and six months have passed.
